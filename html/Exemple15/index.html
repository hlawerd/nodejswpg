				<p>The Church of Scientology hasn’t commented, but a DirecTV spokesperson confirmed the Monday launch to THR.</p>
				<p>According to a promo video, the new network will occupy the satellite service’s channel 320, which currently airs infomercials.
				   Early last year, Scientology reporter Tony Ortega brought up rumors of a Church network.
					That wasn’t a huge surprise to those who follow the church as it had already announced the launch of its own studio with Scientology Media Productions in 2016.
					The church, led by David Miscavige, has long had lofty ambitions to reach more people. For example, it recently spent millions to run a Super Bowl commercial.
					The THR website has reported that, “It’s not immediately clear what the network will entail, or who from the church’s deep bench of famous members may be enlisted for the programming….”
					While Cruise has remained Scientology’s highest profile member, Leah Remini famously left the Church and did the documentary expose series Scientology and the Aftermath on the A & E Channel to reveal alleged misdeeds. (The Church of Scientology has denied Remini’s claims).
					Scientology expert Ortega has reported on his blog, The Underground Bunker, that church leader Miscavige held a top-secret meeting for Scientology leaders from all over the world recently, leading him to suspect the TV channel was imminent.
					Ortega admitted to Radar that he isn’t sure Cruise’s entertainment team would allow him to take on the scientology TV project because he’s already busy “bringing in billions of dollars around the world.”
					Cruise resumed filming the latest Mission: Impossible film after suffering a broken ankle while performing a dangerous stunt in August.</p>
